I am a Researcher at the Centre for Research and Studies in Sociology (CIES-Iscte) since 2020 and an Invited Assistant Professor at Iscte – University Institute of Lisbon. I received my PhD in Sociology from the University of Cambridge in 2019.

My research focuses on collective action and contemporary politics, with a particular interest in social movements, political parties, and their interactions. I study how political contention emerges, diffuses, and becomes institutionalised, examining both the public dimension of protest and its backstage articulation with parties and institutions

Methodologically, I combine qualitative and quantitative approaches, including protest event analysis, comparative and case study methods, and computational tools for large-scale data collection and analysis. In my work, I have also advanced methodological innovations by extending the idea of backstage politics to capture different forms of involvement and interaction among collective actors.

My dissertation was awarded the Portuguese Political Science Association Prize for Best Dissertation (2022) and it was published by Amsterdam University Press with the title Contesting Austerity having received the João Ferreira de Almeida Prize (2024). My research has been published in journals such as European Societies, Environmental Science & Policy, Housing Studies, Review of African Political Economy, Social Movement Studies, Environmental Sociology and Religion, State & Society, among others. I have also contributed to the Oxford Handbook of Climate Action (2025) and the Handbook of Research Methods and Applications for Social Movements (2024).

Beyond academia, I write and record music under the stage name A Serious Man.
